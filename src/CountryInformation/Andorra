Andorra,[d] officially the Principality of Andorra,[2][e] is a sovereign landlocked
country on the Iberian Peninsula, in the eastern Pyrenees in Southwestern Europe,
bordered by France to the north and Spain to the south. Believed to have been created
by Charlemagne, Andorra was ruled by the count of Urgell until 988, when it was
transferred to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell. The present principality was
formed by a charter in 1278. It is currently headed by two co-princes: the Bishop of
Urgell in Catalonia, Spain, and the president of France. Its capital and largest city
is Andorra la Vella.
