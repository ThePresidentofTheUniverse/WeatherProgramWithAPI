Switzerland,[d] officially the Swiss Confederation,[e] is a landlocked
country located in west-central Europe.[f][13] It is bordered by Italy
to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria
and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is geographically divided
among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura; the Alps occupy the
greater part of the territory, whereas most of the country's nearly
9 million people are concentrated on the plateau.
