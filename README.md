OVERVIEW:
This is relaitvely simple weather program that utilizes the two APIs known as Meteo.api and zippopotam.us, built within the time span of five days.

WHAT DOES IT DO?
Coming in both console-app form and GUI form, this is a program that gives the user a forecast of the weather over a seven day period in several different
countries through the means of utilizing zipcodes. It also displays the Latitude, Longitude, City, Country name, image of country and some basic information
about the country.

HOW TO USE:
While not preferable, to use the console app, the user must enter a valid country initials that zippopotam.us uses, they also need to type in the zipcode,
prefered temperature unit and prefered wind speed unit. Please note that the console app's primary purpose is for testing, thus it is incredibly barebones.

To use the application, the user needs to pick country from a drop-down box, type in an adequate zipcode, and also select the temperature unit and wind
speed unit from two different drop down boxes as well. After that, the user can click the "Generate forecast" button, in which it will show the next
seven days of weather in a table, using the location they inputted.
